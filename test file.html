<h1> Bon Appetit </h1>
<p> Chez Fur welcomes you to come by for coffee and snacks. Stay to be entertained by our furry hosts as they play on our outdoor Katio or indoor Kitty Kondo. While some of our hosts may be a bit shy, others are happy to greet you with a request for a head scratch or a gentle pet. Just let them lead the way! Sit back and enjoy the company of the cats. You may find that one of our cuddly kitties would like to adopt you. </p>
